# Testing Database Connection

The connection is now working (no more "can't reach server" error), but authentication is failing.

## Current Issue
Authentication failed - the credentials might be incorrect.

## Possible Issues:

1. **Username format**: The connection string uses `postgres.swnbqometoktlfyraeve` as username
   - Make sure this matches your Supabase dashboard exactly

2. **Password**: The password `[SaudiArabia2030]` is URL-encoded correctly
   - But double-check: is this your actual database password?
   - You can find/change it in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database → Database password

3. **Connection string format**: 
   - Make sure you copied the exact connection string from Supabase dashboard
   - Some Supabase projects use different formats

## Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Verify your database password:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
   - Check your database password or reset it

2. **Copy the exact connection string:**
   - Go to Settings → Database → Connection string
   - Copy the exact string they provide (including any parameters)
   - Replace only the `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` part

3. **Test with Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Try connecting via Supabase SQL Editor to verify your password works

The good news is: **The connection is working** - we just need the correct credentials!
